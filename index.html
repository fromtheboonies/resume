            What are you looking for?  You must be a coder or designer since nobody else views source.
            This is nothing fancy - just slapped it together from a generic base template I found for a simple and free web presence to help spread my tech gospel.
            I design and develop complex web applications that help businesses get stuff done, not websites for marketing purposes.
            If you think it should be fancier, or if you want to give me some praise; you can contact me via any of the listed contact details.
